### Reflection
###

# ... This has taken me a week and still I am way behind and the programs are not working.
#I will update this section later with all the collaborators. I would say I have spent over 12 hours
# working on this
Write how long this assignment took you, including doing all the readings
# ... and tutorials linked to from the homework page. Did the readings, tutorials,
# ... and lecture contain everything you needed to complete this assignment?
